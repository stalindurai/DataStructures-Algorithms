		 ********* Sliding Window.*****************
		 * Input: int Array (Either 0 or 1) and int k [0 <= k <= Array's length].
		 * 
		 * Output: int length (that is maximum number of consecutive 1s)
		 * 
		 **** Psuedocode:
		 *	  define maxlen and p1 and p2 pointers.
		 *	define hashmap for storing char as key and its count as value.
		 *	start while loop and perform until p2<string length)
		 *	keep storing the characters in the map with count using getorDefault.
		 *	check for count>1 inside while loop. this means duplicate occurence came.
		 *	so start deleting the chars from hashmap by decrementing the count until the duplicate occurence just added
		 *	 was found(using count>1) by incrementing p1 pointer(p1++);
		 *.(This is because , to remove all the prev characters until current duplicate char from subarray length count. 
		 *	so after removing this, new subarray remains in the map without duplicate and starts to calculate len.using maxlen.
		 *p2++.
		 * p2 is a fast pointer. p1 is a slow pointer. 
		 * p2 keeps adding character into the map. and stops when duplicate char occured.
		 * p1 pointer starts to delete occurence in map until this duplicate char is removed.(because prev chars should not come
		 * into the maxlength non duplicate length calculation.) so by keeping p1 pointer static, and using p2 current char count>2,
		 * updating the count in the map and increasing pointer till duplicate occurence is found.)
		 * so next time when another duplicate char comes. p1 again get incremented and deletes all prev characters from map until
		 * duplicate char occurence is found. this repeats until p2 reaches the end of the string.
		 * so in the end whatever the maxLen has, will be returned as maximum length.
		 *	. 
		 * 3 pointers required. one is to calculate starting position of valid 1.another is to check where first 0 is
		 * flipped. last one is to check where second 0 is flipped.
		 * once second zero is flipped, then calculate length. using current index - p1 + 1 gives length.
		 * after we finish flipping the second 0, we need to set pointers again. one to point the starting position of 1.
		 * another to point the second changed 0 as first pointer position.
